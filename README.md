# telements
The Telements library offers a set of customizable UI components written in JavaScript / TypeScript. The default theme of the library can be easily replaced so that a corresponding corporate identity of a dedicated brand can be represented.

# Under construction
The library is still under construction. You will find the current state in the [`development`](https://github.com/telekom/telements/tree/development) branch.
