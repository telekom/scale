### We, the team, that build the Scale Design System, want to share some exciting updates with you.

After many years, where Scale has been built by a very small team, enabling others to build their products and prototypes, **we were given the opportunity to make a huge leap on the matter.**

In collaboration with our internal design system community, we have assessed current solutions against leading design systems, identifying areas for improvement that we aim to address with this next step. Thanks again to everyone involved so far.

**We could not be happier to announce that we already started working on the next evolution of the Telekom Design System, planned to support all major customer related products of DT Group in Europe.**

Yes, this is ambitious, but we grew as a team and firmly believe we can do it. Bear with us.

**With this new focus, we also must leave the Scale Design System evolution to those who already helped to grow it: The Open-Source Community.**

While sadly, we are not able to provide support anymore and will not build new components, keep in mind Scale is alive and all well
and can be used as is. Feel free to publish fixes and improve the solid foundation, we built. Even better, for those interested, since we are now working on a larger scale than ever before, we will try to enable an update path to the next evolution of the Design System.

We made you curious?

Perfect.

Stay tuned, more details to follow.

### What is changing now:

We’ll migrate the Scale Figma libraries in our Telekom enterprise workspace. Afterward, your product files will be disconnected from the library. All Telekom projects stored externally have to migrate to the Telekom account as well. Once that’s done, the components will automatically link to the library.

If you want to have the libraries visible in your draft folder: Click on the link “enable libraries for all files in your drafts” under settings. Activate the libraries you need and you will find them in your personal draft.

### Access to Figma libraries

### Telekom employees

Step 1: <br/>
Get a Telekom Enterprise account [by following these instructions](https://seu30.gdc-dmst01.t-systems.com/confluence/display/SETOOLSBETRIEB/Figma@DT+How+to+add+User).

Step 2: <br/>
Migrate your working files from an external account into our Telekom Figma account in order to utilize the library and reconnect the components. Reach out to the <a href="mailto:seu-operation@t-systems.com"> Telekom Figma Admin </a> for assistance, or submit a ticket to [Figma Support](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001731233).

Step 3: <br/>
After migrating the files, the components will automatically reconnect to the Scale library hosted in the Telekom Figma space. You have the option to enable the library in your files directly from the library panel.

Step 4: <br/> Invite external collaborators to the files using the share feature in Figma. External collaborators will require edit rights in the Telekom Figma Account to collaborate, and any associated costs will be charged to the project cost center.

Note: <br/>
Scale Figma link: All internal employee with a Telekom Figma Enterprise License can access the file through the existing link after Scale migration.

<br/>

### Externals

Externals can utilize the Scale library exclusively with a Telekom Figma Enterprise Account.

Step 1: <br/>
Migrate your working files to your Telekom Figma account to utilize the library and reconnect the components. If you need assistance, contact your <a href="mailto:seu-operation@t-systems.com"> Telekom Figma Admin </a> or submit a ticket to [Figma Support](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001731233).

Step 2: <br/>
Obtain a guest account with the Telekom Figma Enterprise Account. Typically, after migrating your project, all collaborators in the files are automatically added as guests to Telekom. If you do not yet have access to Telekom Figma, please contact your Telekom internal project contacts to get an invitation. Be sure to mention the project you are working on and provide the name of an internal contact person you are collaborating with.

Step 3: <br/>
After migrating the files, the components will automatically reconnect to the Scale library hosted in the Telekom Figma space. You have the option to enable the library in your files directly from the library panel.

Note: <br/>
Scale Figma Link: All external collaborators will not be able to access the Scale Figma library file via the existing link after migration. If you require access to the file, please <a href="mailto:contact@brand-design.telekom.com"> get in touch with us</a> to be invited. Please ensure to specify the project you are involved in and provide the name of an internal contact person you are collaborating with.
