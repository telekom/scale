A Callout component provides a way for users to highlight important content visually.

## General

### When to use

- Mainly used in marketing assets to highlight very specific information on the page, in order to differentiate it from the surrounding content
  - For example, to state and highlight prices
  - for numbers up to 5 characters
  - For short sentences, numbers with short text

### When not to use

- Use callouts sparingly for them to maintain effectiveness
- Do not use multiple callouts on the same section/ page/ topic - this would district the user and lessen the importance of the callout
- When longer text is needed
- (maybe mention max characters to be used)

## Variants

### Colors

There are 5 color variants:

- **Standard:** inverts the colors in dark and light mode
- **Magenta, Blue:** Stay the same in dark and light mode
- **Black, White:** To be used on images, stay the same in dark and light mode

### Text Size Variants

There are 3 text sizes to offer the most flexibility for different types of content.

It is recommended to use the medium text size for sentences that have only one level of hierarchy.

It is recommended to use the small and large text sizes for information that requires two levels of hierarchy.

For both options, the bubble size adjusts to the content.

### Rotation

The callout can be rotated for specific use cases. We recommend using it sparingly.
