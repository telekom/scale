Radio buttons allow users to choose an option from a number of
alternatives. The radio button group also contains a group label.

## General

Radio buttons only work as a group. Activating a radio button
automatically deselects the previously selected option. With a group
label, users can grasp contextual context more quickly. Interfaces with
many options appear smoother and tidier overall.

### When to use

Use a radio button group to:

- offer users a range of related but mutually exclusive choices and
- to ensure clarity in the case of several groups of radio buttons.

#### When not to use

Don't use a radio button group when:

- users should select more than one option (use checkboxes instead) or
- users have to perform an action (use a button instead).
