Tabs allow users to quickly switch between different sections of a topic.

## General

Tabs help organize content into logical sections. Arrange tabs horizontally, in the best case up to 5 and not more than one row. Each tab presents related content from the same level of hierarchy. Within a set of tabs, the first tab is active by default.

### When to use

Use tabs to separate a large amount of content without having to reload the page.

When creating tabs, make sure the different sections of content are:

- related to each other,
- from the same level of hierarchy,
- clearly distinguished from one another, and
- easily understood as stand-alone content.

### When not to use

Don't use tabs if:

- users might want to compare the content,
- users need to read the content in a particular order (e.g., with processes), or
- you have the option to optimize the content and display it within one viewing element.

## Basic Types

### Text only

For most use cases, tabs with text provide the best orientation.

### Text and icon

Add icons if they help users understand which content a certain tab represents. Do not use the same icon more than once within a set of tabs.

## Sizes

We provide the tab navigation in two sizes: large and small. You can choose one of the two options for purely visual reasons or based on how relevant the content is. For mobile applications, we recommend using the small size.

## Disabled tab

If the content in one tab is temporarily unavailable, you can disable the tab.
A user needs to understand why they can't access a tab, or this will lead to a less-than-ideal experience. Therefore, see if you can maintain the functionality of each tab and explain in the content area when a tab is temporarily unavailable.

> The disabled state is exempt from the WCAG contrast minimum for text colors. You can find more information in the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

## Label

The label clearly describes the content which a particular tab represents. Since short labels are more scannable, don't use more than 1-2 words.

## Best practices

- When the user switches between sections, only the tab and its content area should change â€“ nothing else.
- Arrange the tabs according to the needs of our users.
- Don't mix different types of tabs: for one set of tabs, decide on either having icons or not.
