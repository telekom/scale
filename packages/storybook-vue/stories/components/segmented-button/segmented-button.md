Segmented buttons make it easier for users to filter content, select options, or change views.

## General

A segmented button can consist of two to five selection options, where the options always belong to a common category. Selecting both single and multiple options is possible.

### When to use

Use a segmented button to:

- display selected filters,
- offer functions like sorting content or changing views, or
- provide input options.

### When not to use

Don’t use a segmented button when:

- there are more than five selection options,
- the options are not logically related,
- actions should be triggered (e.g., editing, adding, or deleting), or
- the view should switch between separate content (use tabs instead).

## Basic types

### Single selection

As with the Radio Button Group, users can only select one option. One option is always preselected. If necessary, specify a neutral option – for example "All" to override the set filters.

### Multiple selection

As with Check Box Groups, users can also select multiple options. Multiple selections are typically used to filter content.

## Variants

### Text only

A text that describes the option is ideal for most use cases. In the selected state, add a checkmark icon to the segmented button.

### Icon and text

Add appropriate icons to clarify options (optional). In the selected state, a checkmark icon replaces the previously displayed icon.

### Icon only

If the icon clearly refers to the action, you can omit the text. In this case, set an aria-label for the screen reader.
By default, icons are used in the outline variant. Flat icons indicate a selected status.

## Sizes

Segmented buttons are available in three different sizes:

- Small
- Medium
- Large

The width of the segmented button initially adapts to the length of the text, but can also be switched to full width if necessary. If the width is defined by the text length, all segments fit to the longest segment.

## Disabled state

If an interaction is temporarily unavailable, you can deactivate the entire component or just individual segments of the segmented button.

## Elements

### Group label (1) (optional)

Choose a short descriptive title for the whole group (for example, "Sort by" or "Distance").

### Container (2)

The container visually summarizes all the options or fields of a segmented button into a group.

### Segment (3)

Each selection is represented as a segment. With a multiple selection, group adjacent selected segments together.

### Icon (4) (optional)

The icon either supports the label to illustrate the content or replaces the text as a standalone variant.

### Label (5)

The label describes individual choices and should be short and precise.

## Best practice

- Don’t mix variants: text only, text and icon, or icon only.
- Use short and clear labels.
- Offer a neutral option, for example to disable filters and sorting.
- Use the full width option on mobile devices and make sure the total width doesn't exceed the smallest display size (320 px).
