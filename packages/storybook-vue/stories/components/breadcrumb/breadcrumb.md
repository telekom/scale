A breadcrumb is a secondary navigation element that provides additional orientation. It helps users find their current position in the information architecture and allows them to easily navigate back.

## General

A breadcrumb reflects the information hierarchy of your product or service. The first entry is typically the site's homepage; the last entry is the current page.

### When to use

Use a breadcrumb particularly for complex products or services with three or more levels of navigation. Always use breadcrumbs on all the pages of a website.

### When not to use

If your product or service has a flat architecture with only one or two levels of hierarchy, a breadcrumb will not necessarily enhance the user experience. Never use it as a replacement for the primary navigation.

## Elements

### Page links (1)

Start with the link to the parent page at the highest level (typically the homepage). Every further link leads one level lower. The link label should be short and precise.

### Divider (2)

The arrow icon visually separates the individual pages.

### Current page (3)

The current page is highlighted at the right end of the breadcrumb. It has no interactive functionality.
