The Dropdown Select is a new version of the [dropdown](?path=/docs/components-dropdown--standard) component. The dropdown menu is now an integrated part and is no longer generated by the browser as before. This makes the component less error-prone. In particular, errors that could occur when switching between light and dark modes are now avoided.
