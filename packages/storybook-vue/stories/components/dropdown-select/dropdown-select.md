The Dropdown Select is a new version of the [dropdown](?path=/docs/components-dropdown--standard) component. The dropdown menu is now an integrated part and is no longer generated by the browser as before. This makes the component less error-prone. In particular, errors that could occur when switching between light and dark modes are now avoided.

## Beta components

This component is still in the beta phase. When testing it, keep in mind that it may not have gone through all quality control measures, and it may not yet have WCAG accessibility certification. There may be changes to this component in the future.
