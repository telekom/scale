A loading spinner signals that the system is executing a process. It lets users know that the system has understood and processed their request.

## General

A loading spinner is a circular symbol that rotates in a continuous loop. It doesn't give users any information about the expected waiting time.

### When to use

- Use a loading spinner when there is a waiting time between 2-10 seconds.

### When not to use

Don't use a loading spinner if:

- the waiting time is less than 2 seconds or
- the waiting time is longer than 10 seconds. Here, users should get information about how long the waiting time is likely to be (see Progress Bar).

## Variants

Scale contains a spinner with a horizontal alignment and a vertical alignment.
