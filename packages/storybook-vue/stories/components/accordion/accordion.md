Accordions help organize and present large amounts of content with an efficient use of space. They allow users to move through content and explore which topics to read.

## General

An accordion holds a list of headlines stacked vertically and offers a general overview of the content. Users can quickly scan all the headlines and decide which content to continue reading.

### When to use

Use an accordion to:

- help users find relevant content more quickly,
- organize a large amount of related content in a small space, or
- show content which users don't necessarily need to read all the way through.

### When not to use

Bear in mind that accordions require a great deal of interaction. Don't use an accordion when:

- users might need to open the majority of the subtopics,
- users might want to print out the entire page, or
- you're only trying to shorten the page.

## Elements

#### Icon (1)

The arrow icon indicates whether the panel is open or closed.

#### Title (2)

Choose a topic title which is as clear and descriptive as possible. Try to keep it short so users can grasp the content quickly.

The title and icon are the control for opening the panel.

#### Body text (3)

You can add a simple body text or also insert headlines, split text into paragraphs, and add images or illustrations. Keep it as simple and clear as possible.
