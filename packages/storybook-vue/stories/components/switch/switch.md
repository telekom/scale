Switches allow users to quickly turn an item on or off. Like a physical light switch, they provide an immediate result.

## General

A switch offers two mutually exclusive states (on/off, yes/no). It always has a default value.

### When to use

Use a switch whenever the user may want to immediately activate or deactivate something. It is commonly used as an on/off switch, e.g., to control preferences.

### When not to use

Use radio buttons or a single checkbox if

- the user has to confirm by saving or submitting to apply the new state or
- immediate results are not possible.

## Variants

### Standard / iOS

Use the standard variant for all cross-platform apps or those primarily designed for iOS.

### Android

This variant is ideal if youâ€™re using Scale to build a mobile app that should visually integrate into Android as seamlessly as possible.

## Sizes

The standard variant is available in large and small.

### Large

The large switch works for all web apps. Also, use this variant for cross-platform mobile apps or those designed primarily for iOS.

### Small

Only use this variant for desktop apps. If your layout is responsive, you can change to the large switch for smaller viewport sizes.

## Label

Clearly label the switch and keep it short. For some use cases, a single noun provides the best guidance.
