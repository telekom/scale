Switches allow users to quickly turn an item on or off. Like a physical light switch, they provide an immediate result.

## General

A switch offers two mutually exclusive states (on/off, yes/no). It always has a default value. A solid Magenta color shows it is on, while a dark outline shows it is off.

### When to use

Use a switch whenever the user may want to immediately activate or deactivate something. It is commonly used as an on/off switch, e.g., to control preferences.

### When not to use

Use radio buttons or a single checkbox if

- the user has to confirm by saving or submitting to apply the new state or
- immediate results are not possible.

## Label

Clearly label the switch and keep it short. For some use cases, a single noun provides the best guidance.
