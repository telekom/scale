</div>

A divider is a thin line that helps divide elements into groups. This makes it easy for users to identify content that belongs together.

## General

Dividers have a subtle visual effect â€“ visible but never dominant.

### When to use

Only use a divider:

- when using whitespace is not sufficient to create a content group or
- when using whitespace is not possible, e.g., when there's not enough space.

### When not to use

Only use a divider when really necessary. To avoid clutter and fragmentation, use as few dividers as possible.
