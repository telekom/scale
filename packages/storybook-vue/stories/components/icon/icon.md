# Icon

Telekom icons seamlessly blend into the design of our websites and apps. They help identify functions quickly and provide a visual illustration of complex or abstract topics.

## General

Deutsche Telekom has its own icon style to convey the brand’s values in a subtle yet essential way.

### When to use

Use icons to help our users grasp the core idea of content and functions quickly. Icons are meant to:

- simplify the use of our products and services by drawing attention to important actions or content and
- enhance the aesthetic appeal of our user interfaces.

### When not to use

Don't use icons for solely aesthetic reasons. Users must immediately recognize the purpose of an icon, or else it will prevent them from completing the task at hand.

## Icon variants

By default, we use outline icons for our user interfaces. They are optimized for light and dark backgrounds. Solid icons emphasize an selected status.

## Static and interactive icons

A static icon has no interactive functionality. An interactive icon can have an assigned function. If an icon is interactive, use the solid version of the icon for the active state.

## Icons and text label

To ensure the best user experience, always provide icons with a text label. We maintain clearly defined icons and terms for our standard functions.

## Accessibility

### Special feature in the code

As soon as single icons convey relevant information in interfaces, create a corresponding alternative text with the code property "accessibilityTitle". This way, the information is also accessible to blind users with screen readers.

You need to include an alternative text if the icon has no visible label (see Close Icon) or contains additional information (e.g., if it’s an external link).

If the icon has a clearly understandable text label (see Download, Edit, Delete in the example above), do not use an alternative text. In this case, the icon only serves as visual support.
