Tags draw the user's attention to certain content elements. They represent a category or an attribute.

## General

Tags consist of relevant keywords in a container. A tag refers to a category or attribute.

### When to use

Use a tag to:

- draw a user's attention to certain elements they might otherwise overlook,
- make it easier for users to recognize content, for instance in tables, or
- show users selected filters.

### When not to use

In general, be careful using tags. Don't use them when:

- users could confuse them with buttons or
- users might not be able to recognize relevant content (particularly if there are too many tags).

## Basic types

### Static tag

A static tag has no interactive function. It only conveys information, for instance a category within a table.

### Dismissible tag

A dismissible tag offers the possibility to remove the tag by clicking/tapping on the icon.

## Variants

Scale offers standard and strong variants. The strong variant is ideal for more emphasis.

## Colors

You can choose your own color for color coding or to achieve a different visual effect. It's important that the color scheme is easily understandable and meets all accessibility requirements.

## Sizes

Scale offers two sizes for tags: large and small. If needed, you can adjust the size of the tags yourself.

### Large

Use large tags as default.
