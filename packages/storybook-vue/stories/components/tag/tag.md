Tags draw the user's attention to certain content elements. They represent a category or an attribute.

## General

Tags consist of relevant keywords in a container. A static tag is non-dismissable and indicates a category or an attribute; an interactive tag is dismissable and shows things like selected filters, which users can then also remove.

### When to use

Use a tag to:

- draw a user's attention to certain elements they might otherwise overlook,
- make it easier for users to recognize content, for instance in tables, or
- show users selected filters.

### When not to use

In general, be careful using tags. Don't use them when:

- users could confuse them with buttons or
- users might not be able to recognize relevant content (particularly if there are too many tags).

## Basic types

### Static tag

A static tag has no interactive function. It only conveys information, for instance a category within a table.

### Interactive tag

An interactive tag offers the possibility to remove the tag by clicking/tapping on the icon. A typical use, for example, is deactivating selected filters.

## Variants

### Colors

The standard color for the tag is black text on light grey. Each defined color has a standard and stronger version with a darker background. Use the stronger version to provide more emphasis.
All standard and strong colors are optimized for legibility and accessibility.

Defined colors:

- Teal
- Olive
- Violet
- Brown
- Cyan
- Yellow
- Green
- Orange
- Red

You can choose your own color for color coding or to achieve a different visual effect. It's important that the color scheme is easily understandable and meets all accessibility requirements.

### Sizes

Scale offers two sizes for tags: large and small. If needed, you can adjust the size of the tags yourself.

### Large

Use large tags as default.

## Best practices

- Decide on one size for your tags.
- Use a clear keyword for the label.
