A list arranges related pieces of information in a vertical group. This makes it easier for users to scan the content for relevant information.

## General

You can choose between an ordered, unordered, or definition list.

### When to use

Use a list to:

- avoid large bulks of information in paragraphs,
- highlight content that would otherwise be lost in the body text,
- communicate complicated content or processes step by step, or
- provide the definition of terms.

### When not to use

Emotionally charged content is not suitable to present as a list.

## Basic types

### Ordered list

You can convey a specific hierarchy by using an ordered list. The list items follow a series. Indent items to display subordinate information.

### Unordered list

The items of an unordered list have equal status. The list will not convey a specific order. Nevertheless, you should organize the items in a logical way that users can easily understand (e.g., alphabetically or chronologically). Even if there is no specific order, you can display different levels of hierarchy by indenting.
