The footer finishes off all Telekom websites. Users can find important information, global links, and additional functions in the footer.

## General

Scale offers different variations of the footer. Links to the legal notice and data protection information, as well as the acknowledgement of Deutsche Telekom as the content provider, are required for all variations.

## Basic Types

Depending on the scope and orientation of your product, decide on a variation of the Telekom footer: minimal, standard, or extended.

### Standard

In this variation, the dark background color clearly signifies the end of the page. The standard footer contains the logo and claim. You can use this variation of the footer for pages with low complexity or little relevance for search engine optimization.

### Minimal

The minimal footer is very reduced in its presentation. Just like the standard version, it is suitable for pages with low complexity or little relevance for search engine optimization.
