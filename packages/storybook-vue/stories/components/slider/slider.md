A slider lets users control a value or a range of values.

## General

A slider displays the current value or range of values by default. Users can increase or decrease the value or range of values by moving a handle along a bar. Using a slider usually triggers an immediate effect (e.g., adjusting a setting like volume or filtering data).

### When to use

Use a slider when:

- the user needs to quickly adjust a value,
- adjusting the value or range triggers an immediate effect, or
- the input doesn’t have to be precise (e.g., for a volume slider, the value can be hidden).

### When not to use

Don’t use a slider when:

- the users might want to pick a precise value (here an input field works better),
- there is no immediate effect needed/wanted,
- the range is very large (e.g., more than 1-1500), or
- the range is very small (e.g., 1-3).

## Basic types

Each slider needs a label which describes the value that is changing. Always display the current value by default.

### Single value slider

The user can set a precise value (e.g., $200) from the pre-defined range.

The selected value changes in real time as the knob moves.

The increase/decrease is by increments of 1.

### Range slider

The user can control both the starting point and end point of the value range they want to set.

The value increase/decrease from both knobs is by increments of 1.

### Stepped slider

The slider increases and decreases the value by set increments (e.g., increments of 10 instead of 1).

### Colors

Telekom sliders use Magenta as an accent color. If you need to apply a custom color, you can either use colors from the Telekom color palette or create a new one. When customizing, use a color-code scheme that is clear to the user and meets all accessibility requirements.

### Disabled state

Disable the slider if:

- another action has to take place before the slider is usable or
- users cannot change the value at the moment.

When disabled, remove the knobs to show that the value can’t be changed.
