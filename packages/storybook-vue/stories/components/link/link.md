A link is an interactive piece of text. It typically forwards users to another location or file.

## General

A link provides an additional option for navigation. It can appear alone as an independent element or exist within a larger piece of text, like a sentence or paragraph. Links have a particular color and style. Use links with a clear purpose; too many links can disorient users.

### When to use

Use links to:

- forward users to a different page (within your product/service or from an external site),
- direct users to another section on the same page, or
- make phone numbers or emails interactive.

### When not to use:

Use a button when you want users to perform a specific action.

## Variants

### Text only

A text-only link can appear alone, within a sentence or body of text, or directly following content.

### Text and icon

Add an icon to label certain categories, e.g., links to external sites, documents, downloads, etc. Make sure to use icons consistently within your product or service.

### Link without underline

If the underlining looks distracting within the layout, use the link without it. This may be the case in forms, for example.

## Link text

- Each link text should be unique to avoid problems with screen readers.
- A link text should be as short as possible â€“ typically one to three words. However, a link needs to be long enough to clearly convey its purpose. In certain cases, you can link a full sentence, but avoid longer links wherever possible.
- A link text should make sense without any additional context. Using "more information" or "click here" can cause problems for people using screen readers.
