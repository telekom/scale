A progress bar indicates that the system is running a process. This make users feel in control and can help to estimate how long it takes to accomplish a task.

## General

A progress bar is a non-interactive, visual indicator. Depending on whether or not you know the duration of the process, you can use a determinate or indeterminate progress bar.

## Basic Types

### Determinate

For processes where you know the duration, use determinate progress bars. The label specifically indicates how much of the process has already finished. You should use it if a process will take more than 10 seconds.

### Indeterminate

> Available soon

If you cannot determine the duration of a process, use the indeterminate progress bar. This indicates that the system is operating, but doesn't give any idea how long it could take. Therefore, you should always avoid using this type of progress bar whenever possible.

## Colors

Telekom progress bars use Magenta as an accent color. If you need to use a different color for a particular reason, you can either use colors from the Telekom color palette or create a custom one. When customizing, use a color-code scheme that is clear to the user and meets all accessibility requirements.
