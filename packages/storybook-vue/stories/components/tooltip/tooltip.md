Tooltips provide additional information or a definition for an element to help users interact with it.

## General

You can use tooltips on any active element, such as an icon, text link, or button. Tooltips appear on hover, and they are neither focusable nor do they
contain focusable content.

### When to use

Use a tooltip to

- explain a function (e.g. for icons without a label) or
- define an element or a term (e.g. the label of a button, a text link or a term in the body text).

### When not to use

Don't use tooltips to

- convey redundant or obvious information or
- convey essential information (i.e., the desired interaction with the UI must also be clear without a tooltip).

Use tooltips very conservatively and always try to make your UI as self-explanatory as possible.

## Positioning

You can attach tooltips to all four sides of an element. If possible, decide on one positioning for a website. Make sure the tooltip doesnâ€™t hide any content it
describes.

## Elements

<h5>Container (1)</h5>
The container is gray by default. If you want to use a different color, make sure there is enough contrast with the background.

<h5>Text (2)</h5>
The text contains a short, simple and precise description.

## Beta components

This component is still in the beta phase. When testing it, keep in mind that it may not have gone through all quality control measures, and it may not yet have WCAG accessibility certification. There may be changes to this component in the future.
