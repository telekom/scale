Tables help the user grasp and compare data easily.

## General

A table view organizes data into rows and columns. Additional functions like filtering or sorting offer the user the option to adjust the presentation of the data to their own needs.

### When to use

Use a table to:

- organize data so users can easily understand, analyze, and compare it.

### When not to use

Don't use a table when:

- a simple table can't map the complexity of the individual data and functions or
- you can show a data visualization instead.

## Elements

#### Column header (1)

The title in the column header describes the content of the respective column. By default, the column header is static. But you can also use the sorting function so users can sort the content in the column in ascending or descending order.
The sort icon shows when the user has sorted the content in a column.

#### Table row (2)

The content of a row forms a data unit and differentiates from the other rows both visually and in terms of its content.
The first cell of a row contains the title: a meaningful description of the data set.
The other cells can contain a wide variety of content types - in addition to text, for example, are also tags, progress bars, or functions.

A mouse over highlights the rows to make them more readable.

#### Divider (3)

The dividing line separates the table rows from one another.

## Mobile

The table structure and display are the same for both mobile and desktops. To see the entire table, the user can swipe horizontally.

## Best practices

### Content alignment

Always align the content of the first column to the left. Depending on the context or type of content, you can also align the content of the other columns to the right.
