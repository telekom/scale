Pagination divides content across multiple pages. Users can also navigate through the content using pagination.

## General

Pagination is an interactive element for users to navigate through several pages of related content. With multiple pages, numbering also helps to keep track of things. The arrows help users navigate quickly.

The default number displayed will vary depending on the context.

### Use pagination when:

- content is too long for a URL or viewport to display or
- you want to provide additional functions for users to interact with the data.

### Don't use pagination when:

- all the content is relevant, since users don't necessarily click through all pages, or
- all the content is important for search engines, since this classifies content as less relevant on subsequent pages.
