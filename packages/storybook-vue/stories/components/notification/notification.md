Notifications give users feedback about the status of the system or an action.

## General

Scale offers toast, banner, and inline notifications.

### When to use

Use notifications to:

- inform users about the status of an action,
- provide a system message, or
- communicate updates like "New Message".

### When not to use

Don't use a notification when:

- the user needs to confirm a decision to prevent or correct critical errors (here, use a modal instead).

## Basic types

### Toast notification

Toast notifications appear immediately after a specific event. They donâ€™t refer to an object on the page and are temporarily displayed in a global position.
Toast notifications can cover other content and hide automatically after a short time. Alternatively, users can actively close them. If necessary, use a link to
provide further information.
