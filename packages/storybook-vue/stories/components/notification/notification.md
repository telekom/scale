The standard Notification Message component can be used to output a notification message. In addition, a short explanatory text can be added to it.

## Beta components

This component is still in the beta phase. When testing it, keep in mind that it may not have gone through all quality control measures, and it may not yet have WCAG accessibility certification. There may be changes to this component in the future.
