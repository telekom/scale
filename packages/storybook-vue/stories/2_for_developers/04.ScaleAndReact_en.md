# Scale and React

React supports Web Components but there are a couple of limitations to be aware of, listed below. Fortunately, it's possible to work around these limitations.

You can find an example boilerplate app in the examples folder in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/telekom/scale/tree/main/examples).

## Setup

First, install the package:

```bash
npm install @telekom/scale-components
```

Load the component library and the CSS in `index.js`:

```js
import { defineCustomElements } from '@telekom/scale-components/loader';
import '@telekom/scale-components/dist/scale-components/scale-components.css';

// ...

defineCustomElements();
```

TODO usage it without the wrappers

TODO alternative usage it with the wrappers ("we provide automatically-generated custom element wrappers")

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ScaleButton } from '@telekom/scale-components-react';
import './App.css';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <div>
    <ScaleButton>Label</ScaleButton>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

## Limitations

- Data Binding — It [passes all props to custom elements as HTML attributes](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11347)
- Custom events — React has its own [synthetic event system](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

- @skatejs/val (https://github.com/skatejs/val)
- reactify-wc (https://github.com/BBKolton/reactify-wc)

## Events in React

In order to prevent collisions with standard events and compatibility with other libraries and frameworks, the custom events emitted by some Scale components are prefixed with `scale`. Event names are camelCased (e.g. `scaleChange`). You can find documentation for these custom events on the respective component pages in the docs section.

Due to React's [synthetic events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html), binding to custom events requires some extra work. You can use an interop layer like the ones listed above, or alternatively use `ref` to bind imperatively with `addEventListener`.

## Styles

> Remember that some web components are in shadow DOMs and are not stylable from the outside. Content injected as children is always stylable.

## Proxy packages

TODO

The automatically generated "proxy" packages will be deprecated in v4, and removed in v5:

- `@telekom/scale-components-react`
- `@telekom/scale-components-react-neutral`
