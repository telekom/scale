# Setup for Developers

Scale provides frontend developers and engineers with a collection of reusable web components to build websites and user interfaces in major frontend frameworks like Vue, React, Angular, and HTML.

Adopting the Scale design system enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work.

## Setting things up

Install the component library in your project with `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install @telekom/scale-components
```

To use the components, you need to load a CSS file and some JavaScript. The CSS file includes the fonts and the design tokens.

### Plain HTML

```bash
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@telekom/scale-components/dist/scale-components/scale-components.css">
<script type="module" src="node_modules/@telekom/scale-components/dist/scale-components/scale-components.esm.js"></script>
```

Using Scale in a plain HTML or Angular Environment comes with one specialty. Because HTML customElements (like Scale Elements) don't support self-closing Tags, you need to close them by yourself. In Vue or React this does not apply.

```html
<p>
  Don't do this:
  <scale-icon-home-home size="16" />
  Do this:
  <scale-icon-home-home size="16"></scale-icon-home-home>
</p>
```

### With a bundler or ES modules

```bash
import "@telekom/scale-components/dist/scale-components/scale-components.css";
import { applyPolyfills, defineCustomElements } from "@telekom/scale-components/loader";

applyPolyfills().then(() => {
  defineCustomElements(window);
});
```
