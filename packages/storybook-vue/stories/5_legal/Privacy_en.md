We reserve the right to statistically analyze anonymized data records.

Your data will be processed in Germany and other European countries. If, in exceptional cases, your data is processed in countries outside the European Union (in so-called third countries), this will take place:

<ol type="a">
  <li>if you have expressly consented to this (Article 49 (1) a GDPR). (In most countries outside the EU, the level of data protection does not meet EU standards.

  <li>or to the extent necessary for our service provision to you (Article 49 (1) b GDPR),</li>
  <li>or to the extent required by law (Article 49 (1) c GDPR).</li>
