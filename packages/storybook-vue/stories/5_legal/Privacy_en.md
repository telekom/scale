Your data will be processed in Germany and other European countries. If, in exceptional cases, your data is processed in countries outside the European Union (in so-called third countries), this will take place:

<ol type="a">
  <li>if you have expressly consented to this (Article 49 (1) a GDPR). (In most countries outside the EU, the level of data protection does not meet EU standards.

  <li>or to the extent necessary for our service provision to you (Article 49 (1) b GDPR),</li>
  <li>or to the extent required by law (Article 49 (1) c GDPR).</li>
</ol>

Furthermore, your data will only be processed in third countries if certain measures ensure a suitable level of data protection (e.g., EU Commission's adequacy decision or suitable guarantees, Article 44 et seq. GDPR).
