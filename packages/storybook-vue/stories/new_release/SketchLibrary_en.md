        We will migrate the scale design libraries to our Telekom enterprise account. Files outside of our account, will get disconnected .

## Light and dark mode

Scale contains its own library for light and dark mode. This way, you can design your interface in either light or dark mode. It’s possible to change this anytime at the push of a button, so you can assess a given effect in the other mode. But even without additional designs, the development team can activate the other mode.

## Prototype

Each interactive component is already built with prototype functionality. This helps test prototypes and your product even faster.

## Documentation

Each component includes a short description and a link to the detailed documentation on the respective usage page of the Scale website.

## Updates

Users working on the Telekom account will receive regular updates from the library. To access the published libraries, ensure that external users are added to the Telekom account.
