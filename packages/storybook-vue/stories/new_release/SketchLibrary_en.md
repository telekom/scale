# Update Sketch Library

Dark mode release 05.04.2022

Scale now includes all components in [dark mode](./?path=/docs/guidelines-light-and-dark-mode--page). The light mode version has also been optimized. Both modes are available as two separate Sketch libraries. Modes can be switched by replacing one library with the other.

## Important for existing projects

To take full advantage of the new features, your components and colors should be linked to the library. Especially self-defined colors remain unaffected by the update. In order to avoid unwanted effects caused by an automatic update of the library, we are providing a new library for this release. Please read the following points first and only then load the new library via the button below.

## How to best prepare your project for the update

### 1. Check your layout for detached components

Check your layout for detached components, otherwise they cannot be updated via the library update. Name the layer group of the detached component like the corresponding symbol in the library. Now you can simply replace it with the symbol from the library: Menu Layer -> Replace with.

### 2. Make sure your elements are linked to colors from the library

By clicking on a layer and then selecting Fill and/or Border in the inspector panel, you can see whether a color is individually selected or whether it comes from the selected default library color. The correct color tokens must be applied for the library to be fully functional. Find out more in our Design Tokens guideline

## Reverting back to the previous version of the library

Download the previous version and replace the new version. In Sketch, click the notification in the top-right corner. A flyout opens with the option: Components update available. This option will revert your layout back to the previous version.
