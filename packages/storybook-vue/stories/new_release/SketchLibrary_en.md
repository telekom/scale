## Light and dark mode

Scale contains its own library for light and dark mode. This way, you can design your interface in either light or dark mode. Itâ€™s possible to change this anytime at the push of a button, so you can assess a given effect in the other mode. But even without additional designs, the development team can activate the other mode.

## Prototype

Each interactive component is already built with prototype functionality. This helps test prototypes and your product even faster.

## Documentation

Each component includes a short description and a link to the detailed documentation on the respective usage page of the Scale website.

## Updates

Users working on the Telekom account will receive regular updates from the library. To access the published libraries, ensure that external users are added to the Telekom account.
