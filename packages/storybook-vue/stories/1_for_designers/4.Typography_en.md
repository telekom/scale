# Typography

Typography has a huge influence on the usability and functionality of our interfaces. It helps us guide users through a product or service.

## General

In addition to our color and logo, the TeleNeo font is a central design element for our brand recognition. To make a lasting impact on the customer experience, use our corporate font for the written word in all our products and services.

The [Liquid Design Brand Concept](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/en/articles/l/liquid-brand-design-concept/) gives us the freedom and flexibility to adapt our font to the particular target group and context. You can find detailed information about TeleNeo, including formats, best practices, character sets, and range of functionality, in the article [Typography](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/en/articles/t/typography/).

## TeleNeo font styles

TeleNeo has five font styles that are evenly graded in terms of weight. When used properly, they emphasize and clarify the content hierarchy. Each font style is also available as italics. Use the italic style only as an exception, e.g., for references in quotations or something similar.

## Font formats for user interfaces

Scale uses a selected combination of font formats to create clear and focused interfaces. A selection from the following font formats is well suited for designing your content.

| Heading 02    | .scl-font-variant-heading-2    |
| Heading 03    | .scl-font-variant-heading-3    |
| Heading 04    | .scl-font-variant-heading-4    |
| Heading 05    | .scl-font-variant-heading-5    |
| Heading 06    | .scl-font-variant-heading-6    |
| Body large    | .scl-font-variant-body-large   |
| Body long     | .scl-font-variant-body         |
| Body short    | .scl-font-variant-body-short   |

## Colors

When choosing text colors, it’s most important to consider legibility. The minimum contrast for small texts is 4.5 to 1.
Scale contains standard colors for texts, text links, and user feedback like error and success messages.

## Hierarchy through typography

Clearly distinguishable font hierarchies provide orientation and make important information immediately apparent.

Example 1: The focus on the headline with lead text (Body large) allows for a smooth transition into the content. The left alignment supports the flow of reading.

Example 2: Section headings help easily structure more complex content.

## Legibility

### Line spacing

Longer body text is easier to read if the line spacing is slightly increased. For text with more than three lines, use the "Body long" format (TeleNeo Regular 16 px with 24 px line spacing).

Short texts are easier to grasp when they appear more compact.
For just a few lines, use the "Body short" format (TeleNeo Regular 16 px with 20 px line spacing).

### Line length

Lines that are too long tire readers out. Lines that are too short make it difficult to read the text.
The table of font formats shows our recommendations for the appropriate line length for different font sizes.

![Image Name](assets/2_guidelines/3_typography/zeilenlaengen01.png)

The line of a headline with the size Heading 01 should consist of approx. 30 - 50 characters. Avoid multi-line headlines.

A line of copy text (here: Body short) should consist of minimum 25 and maximum 80-100 characters.
