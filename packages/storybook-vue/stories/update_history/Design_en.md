**Color tokens**

The new UI colors white and black are well suited when the color is identical in dark and light mode.

## New dropdown select beta component

02.08.22

The dropdown menu is now an integrated part and is no longer generated by the browser as in the [current version](./?path=/docs/components-dropdown--standard). This makes the component less error-prone. In particular, errors that could occur when switching between light and dark modes are now avoided.

We aim to deprecate the [Dropdown](./?path=/docs/components-dropdown--standard) component in favour of the newly released beta [Dropdown Select](./?path=/docs/beta-components-dropdown-select--standard) as soon as new component gets our of the beta phase.

## Simplification of UI color tokens

11.07.22

We have simplified the structure of UI colors and removed duplications. You can find <a href="https://github.com/telekom/design-tokens/pull/192#issuecomment-1178815001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a detailed overview of the changes here</a>.
