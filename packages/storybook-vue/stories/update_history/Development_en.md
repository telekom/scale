# Development Updates

This page documents updates in `@telekom/scale-components` and related packages.

## Dark and light mode (`v3.0.0-beta.100`)

Get it with the `@next` [dist tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag) in npm:

`npm install @telekom/scale-components@next`

The `latest` tag —the version that gets installed by default— will keep being the previous beta from some time. So you can update at your own pace.
