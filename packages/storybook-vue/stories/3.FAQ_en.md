# FAQ

Here is a list of common questions about Scale, along with practical answers.

## Are Scale components accessible?

**They are!**

All Scale components meet the Telekom accessibility requirements as well as the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) version 2.1, level AA criteria.

[Learn more about accessibility](./?path=/story/scale-for-developers-accessibility--page) in Scale and how we test our components.

## Can I integrate Scale into an ongoing project?

**Yes, absolutely!**

Feel free to use Scale components in addition to your own.
That'll save you some time on more general UI work, which you can reinvest to improve parts of the product you otherwise wouldn’t have time to focus on in such detail.

**How does it work?**

If you manage dependencies within your project with npm or yarn and use either a bundler (e.g., Webpack) or ESM, the integration is very simple and straightforward.
For any other case, please get in touch so we can advise on the best setup.

## How do I get access to Scale?

Here are the best ways to get started:

[General documentation](./?path=/story/scale-design-system--page)

[For designers](./?path=/story/scale-for-designers-getting-started--page)

[For developers](./?path=/story/scale-for-developers-setup--page)

Also have Sketch ready to work with Scale.

## How mature is Scale?

Scale is currently an open beta. It is growing and evolving every day. And the contributions of our users are what make it a truly invaluable asset.

[Learn how you can contribute](./?path=/story/contact-contributing-to-scale--page).

## Is Scale open source?

**Yes.**
Our open-source design system is currently an open beta.
We are excited to receive your feedback! And we are delighted if you help us improve Scale with your ideas, experience and skills for developing new components and features.

You can find the [Scale Sourcecode on GitHub](https://github.com/telekom/scale/).

## What if I need a new component?

Here are some ideas:

- Get in touch with the team. We might be able to prioritize your requirements. Ask us about beta or WIP options that could be helpful.
- Create a component locally so it truly fits your specific needs.

If you need a component with specific requirements that Scale doesn't offer:

- Develop the component locally that fits your specific needs. Also, if everyone will benefit, we’d love to [include it in the Scale library](./?path=/story/contact-contributing-to-scale--page).
- Fork an existing component and improve upon it. If your requirements will benefit everyone, we’d love for you to [contribute to Scale](./?path=/story/contact-contributing-to-scale--page).
- Contact us with your exact specifications and implementation ideas. We might be able to develop it.

**A friendly design reminder**
When developing components locally, make sure to follow the Telekom brand and design guidelines and use the quality of the Scale components for orientation.

## What do I need to publish software?

You can include Scale for production just like you would for a local project.

## Can I use Scale for designing email newsletters?

Unfortunately, Scale is not compatible with emails. Please use the [design guidelines and instructions for creating newsletters](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/en/articles/n/newsletter/) on Brand & Design. There you will also find suitable [newsletter templates](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/en/asset/email-template-0-newsletter-templates/).

## What is Scale exactly?

Scale is the new Telekom Digital Design System—a library of production-ready UI components in code and design. The components are brand-compliant and accessible and help you create intuitive interfaces quickly and easily.

The component library is centrally accessible and works with all modern frameworks used for building web applications. Scale is integrated into an optimized toolchain that greatly simplifies the frontend development workflow: As a UX designer you can easily integrate the Scale library into Sketch and receive automated updates. As a frontend developer you will find that implementation and updating with the library on NPM are as easy as it gets.

What's special about Scale: the UX design libraries are generated directly from Code. Scale is thus the single source of truth for both designers and developers. And design and code are always in sync and up to date. And since this single source of truth—Storybook—also holds the entire documentation for design and development, communication will improve within teams since everyone speaks the same language.

## What is the Scale accessibility standard?

We aim at making inclusive products and experiences that serve everyone.
Scale components meet the Telekom accessibility requirements as well as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1, level AA criteria.

[Have a look at our standards](./?path=/story/scale-for-developers-accessibility--page)

**How to achieve full compliance**

While the Scale components and standard theme enable accessible experiences, full compliance with all mandatory accessibility requirements relies on many other factors for your product as a whole.
As such, please have your particular product reviewed by an accessibility consultant to find out how to use the Scale components in the best possible way.

**Suggestions welcome!**

Our goal is to make Scale as accessible as possible. If you have any comments or suggestions on how we can make it better for users with disabilities, please raise an issue on our Git Repo or contact our support team.

## Which browsers are supported?

**We love evergreens!**
All our components are tested to support the most important (evergreen) browsers.

## Who is behind Scale?

A joint team of UX designers and frontend specialists developed Scale with the aim of making frontend development easier, faster, and more effective.
Now, a team of UX designers and developers maintains and refines Scale, making sure it continues to meet the current and future requirements of the project teams using it.

## Why should I use Scale?

Because working with Scale has a host of benefits:

**Faster frontend development:** Production-ready components save time in UX design and development, which means faster time to market for products and services.

**Reduced production costs:** Fully designed and developed components avoid double work and reduce rework.

**Happier teams:** Common resources and a shared language boost collaboration. Less routine tasks mean more time to be creative.

**Easy brand-compliance:** Scale components are consistent with the Liquid Design System and therefore with the Telekom experience principles.

**Better consistency:** With Storybook, all components are collected neatly in one place and are therefore always up to date.

**Hassle-free accessibility:** Scale components fulfill the internal Telekom accessibility standards as well as the AA standard of the W3C, so we can build inclusive products that serve everyone.

**Great flexibility:** Visual and functional elements can be adapted to meet specific project requirements, variants make for more versatility and new themes can be implemented with little technological effort.

**Best compatibility:** Based on the Web Component standard, Scale components are interpreted directly by all modern browsers and can be used with the most common frameworks.

**Smart toolchain:** Scale simplifies handoff and quality assurance processes, provides comprehensive documentation and is easy to integrate into your trusted environment.

**Open source:** Scale is developed further with the help of its users. Your feedback, recommendations and ideas will help us improve our component library continuously.
