# Accessibility

## Serving everyone

We aim at making inclusive products and experiences that serve everyone.
Therefore, Scale components meet the Telekom accessibility requirements as well as the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), level AA criteria.

## Crucial testing

## How to achieve full compliance

While Scale components and the standard theme support accessible experiences, many other factors determine full compliance with all mandatory accessibility requirements of your product as a whole.
Therefore, please have your particular product reviewed by an accessibility consultant to find out how to use the Scale components in the best possible way.

## Suggestions are always welcome

Our goal is to make Scale as accessible as possible. If you have any comments or suggestions on how we can make it better for users with disabilities, please reach out on our Git Repo or contact support.
