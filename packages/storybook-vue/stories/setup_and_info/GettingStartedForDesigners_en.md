# Getting started for designers

With Scale, you can develop brand-compliant, intuitive, and accessible products and services – in a simple and efficient way. The component library contains everything you need to do this.

## 1. Install TeleNeo

The following font is part of the Telekom brand and design assets. It is not open source and may not be used freely. The express consent of Deutsche Telekom is required for commercial use.

[Download TeleNeo](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/asset/font-0-teleneo/)

## 2. Activate the component libraries in your design tool

### Light and dark mode

Scale contains its own library for light and dark mode. This way, you can design your interface in either light or dark mode. It’s possible to change this anytime at the push of a button, so you can assess a given effect in the other mode. But even without additional designs, the development team can activate the other mode.

### Figma libraries

<scale-notification variant="warning" opened heading="We are migrating">
    <p slot="text">
        We will migrate the scale design libraries to our Telekom enterprise account. Files outside of our account, will get disconnected . All Telekom projects stored externally have to migrate to the Telekom account. Once that's done, the components will automatically link to the library.<br/><a href="https://telekom.github.io/scale/?path=/docs/new-release-sketch-library-update--page#access">learn more </a>

### ⚠️ Outdated: Sketch libraries

The Sketch libraries are not up to date and are not being further developed. The Telekom Design Tool will only be Figma in future.
