A checkbox group combines checkboxes with related selection options to form a group.

## General

Clicking on the parent checkbox activates or deactivates a checkbox group. By grouping the content of checkboxes and describing the group, you can present contextual relationships to users more quickly. Interfaces with many options appear smoother and tidier overall.

### When to use

Use a checkbox group when:

- users should select one or more options from a list (e.g., filters in an online shop or a number of settings) and
- users should have the opportunity to activate or deactivate all options at the same time.

### When not to use

Don't use a checkbox group when:

- the selection options aren't closely related.

## Elements

### Parent checkbox (indeterminate state) (1)

Clicking/tapping on the parent checkbox activates or deactivates the whole group. The status of this checkbox shows whether all or only some options are activated or all options are deactivated.

### Group label (2)

Choose a short and meaningful title for the entire group.

### Information (3)Â (optional)

If necessary, you can also provide additional information.

### Child checkbox (4)

The child checkboxes can be activated or deactivated individually.

### Label (5)

Use the label to clearly describe the effect of the respective selection. A label usually contains max three words.

### Error message (6)

If a mandatory option isn't activated (e.g., when it's required to carry out the next step in the process), an error message appears below this checkbox.

### Group error message (7)

If an error message affects the entire group, place it below the group label.

## Deactivated state

A checkbox group or an individual checkbox is deactivated if:

- users have to take another action before using the checkbox or
- the option must be listed but users can't currently select it.

The deactivated state of the entire group occurs automatically when all individual checkboxes are deactivated.
