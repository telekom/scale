This component contains the Scale radio button group. This is used to display the scale radio buttons in a list with a suitable heading.

The heading can be extended with a helper text. If the status of the radio button group is set to error, both the help text and the circles of the radio buttons in the list change colour.

## Beta components

This component is still in the beta phase. When testing it, keep in mind that it may not have gone through all quality control measures, and it may not yet have WCAG accessibility certification. There may be changes to this component in the future.
