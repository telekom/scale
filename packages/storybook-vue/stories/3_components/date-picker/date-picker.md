A date picker allows users to easily select a date or a period of time.

## General

A calendar view shows current, past, and future times.

### Usa a date picker when:

- users should enter a date or period of time and
- all components of the date (day, month, year) are needed and
- the required date can be variable.

### Don't use a date picker when:

- not all of the information (day, month, year) is necessary or
- a date is set and not variable.
