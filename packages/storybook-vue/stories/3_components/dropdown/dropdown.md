With a dropdown, users select an option from a list.

## General

The dropdown temporarily displays a selection list. Thus, the dropdown helps save space when there are multiple options to choose from.

### When to use

Use a dropdown when users:

- can select options within a form,
- should only select one of the options, or
- should filter or sort content.

### When not to use

Donâ€™t use dropdowns, when users:

- should only have a few options (radio buttons may be better),
- should have a lot of choices (an input field with auto-fill is more helpful),
- should have several options (use checkboxes instead), or
- should navigate (use a navigation component like the sidebar navigation).

## Basic Types

### Standard

The standard dropdown from Scale lists all available options.

### Option groups

If you have a lot of options to categorize, you can create groups of options.

## Elements

### Label (1)

The label clearly indicates what kind of options the dropdown provides.

### Icon (2)

The direction of the arrow indicates whether the dropdown menu is open or closed.

### Information (3) (Optional)

Additional information can help clarify the content or purpose of a dropdown.

### Error (4)

If users have to select an option, submitting a form without a selection will result in an error message. If the dropdown already has an information text, the error text will temporarily take its place.

### Title (5)

The title prompts the user to select an option

### Dropdown menu (6)

The dropdown menu contains the available options or groups of options.

## Sizes

Scale offers the dropdown in two sizes. Be careful not to combine the two sizes. Other UI elements such as input fields and buttons should also have the same size.

### Large

Use large dropdowns as the default option.

### Small

When space is limited, use the small dropdown consistently.

## Known issues

The dropdown is ready for use. The component in disabled state is displayed incorrectly with white background in Firefox 85.0.2 (64-bit) in HCM (high contrast mode).
The display error is on the browser side.
