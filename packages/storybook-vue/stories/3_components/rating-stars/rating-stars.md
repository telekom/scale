Rating stars let users share their opinion on a product, service, or piece of content. This way, they help other users make an informed decision and feel more secure when making a purchase.

## General

Rating stars are a customer-focused, highly visual rating system. They can greatly improve the user experience because they help users differentiate between very similar products or services. The more ratings a piece of content has, the more other users can rely on that rating.

### When to use

Use rating stars if:

- you offer a wide range of products, services, or content,
- you want to make the decision easier for users, and
- you have enough users to achieve a meaningful rating.

### When not to use

Don't use rating stars if:

- the amount of products/content is quite small and
- you don't have a significant number of users.

## Types

Rating stars can be interactive or static. Only use one of the two types within a product or service.

**Interactive**<br/>
Interactive rating stars offer the option to select the desired number of stars by clicking/tapping or using keyboard navigation.

**Static**<br/>
Static rating stars don't have an interactive function, but merely convey information.

## Elements

#### Label (1)

The label is hidden by default. Nevertheless, assign a suitable title that screen readers can communicate to visually impaired users, e.g., "Customer rating of product XY".
In some cases, it can make sense to show the label (see Best practices).

#### Active star (2)

#### Inactive star (3)

#### Rating (4)

The rating provides additional information such as the number of previous reviews.

## Sizes

Scale contains rating stars in two sizes. The large size is standard. If there isn't much space available, use the small size. Don't combine both sizes within one product or service.

## Best Practices

If you only want to show the number of star ratings, insert the component as shown above. Always make sure that the positioning clearly shows which content the rating stars belong to.
In some cases, it may make sense to break down the reviews:
