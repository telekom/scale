# Scale Shadows

Shadows make the visual level clear where components and elements are located. They help users quickly understand the UI. As such, itâ€™s important to use the right shadow for a specific use case.

## Flat

For elements without a shadow that lie flat on the surface like buttons.

## Resting

For elements that should be set apart somewhat within a component, such as the knob of a slider or switch.

## Raised

For elements that are visually elevated like a dropdown list or a card.

## Floating

For floating elements like notifications or action buttons (not yet included).

## Top

For elements that are positioned above the main content, like navigations, bottom sheets, etc.

## Overlay

For elements that are temporarily positioned above everything else. Use this for modals, dialogs, or something similar.

## Special shadows

### App bar top

The app bar top shadow tokens are for headers and app bars at the top.

### App bar bottom

The app bar bottom shadow tokens are for bottom bars and other elements that are stuck to the bottom.
