# Grid

The grid is the geometric foundation of all our visual elements - from typography to columns, boxes, icons, and illustrations. It provides structure and guidance for all creative decision-making.

## Base unit

The basic unit of our grid is the eight-pixel square base unit. Multiples of base units compose the dimensions of columns, rows, and boxes, along with their margins and padding. The base unit adapts to your content while maintaining a consistent visual rhythm.
