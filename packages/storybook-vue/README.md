# Storybook Vue

## Adding new components to Storybook

- Take an existing story as an example
- Create a new folder in packages/storybook-vue/stories/3_components
- Create a new dummy Vue component enlisting all props and events
- Create stories
- Add placeholder English and German md files and register them in .storybook/usage-addon/usage.js for the Usage tab to work
