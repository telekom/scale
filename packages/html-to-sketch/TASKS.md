# Release push checklist
Tracking https://gard.telekom.de/gardwiki/display/DTDS/2021+Sketch+File+Progress
    - ( ) Ping new Sketch file & feedback to Anna every afternoon

    - [x] Naming "Default" -> "Standard"
    - [x] Breadcrumb
        - [x] "02 breadcrumb label" should be named "02 Page Links"
        - [x] Example is missing, please add as "00 Example" inside the symbols
        - [x] icon size should be 12px instead of 16px
    - [z] Button
        - [ ] Naming sketch files + storybook need to be aligned
        - [x] Icon only buttons need fixed spacing
            - Storybook component doesn't have scaling whatsoever (but you can hack the CSS and it'll behave like the Sketch symbol).
            - Should the button not be resizable? Or only expandable?
        - [x] Small button icon size
        - [x] Secondary large button is 42x40, should be 40x40
            - Broken in component style (border 1, padding 8, width 24 => 1+1 + 8+8 + 24 = 42)
            - Workaround: make icon size 22
            - Ditto for secondary small button 34x32
    - [z] Checkbox

        - [x] Bar is 1px to the right
            - Broken in the Storybook component
    - [x] Link
        - [x] font weight should be medium
    - [x] Card
        - [x] Use new component
    - [x] Select Box renamed to Dropdown

    - [x] Rename "Input field" to "Text field"
    - [x] textarea scroll is three times in there
    - [x] textarea resizable and expand missing
    - [x] Switch symbol names fixed
    - [x] Progress bar symbol names fixed
    - [x] Switch
        - [x] should have fixed height/width and spacing
    - [x] Tag
        - [x] tag with overwrites the alignment/Spacing is off

    - [x] Text field
        - [x] should have fixed height/width and spacing
            - [x] find layer names that are broken
            - [x] change layer resizing to existing examples of similar type
    - [x] Progress bar
        - [x] Fill is 1px off
            - Issue is that the component is using a 1px transparent border to expand the background fill area and html-to-sketch does borders outside the fill area
            - [x] Find where the border is set
            - [x] Expand the background fill by the border width

        - [x] Set symbol name and text content to doc name, build version and date. 
    - [x] Horizontal slider
    - [x] Fix naming for card
    - [x] Add components to testdoc
    - [x] Resizing
        - Progress bar, slider, text field, textarea, link, 
        - [x] Accordion
        - [x] Tab Navigation
        - [x] Button
            - [x] Text only

        - [x] scp built file and RSS to office server at end of build
    - [x] Table disable resize

    - [ ] Disappears because: inlining style into slotted element doesn't include the :after pseudo-element, because of course it doesn't. Try materializing the pseudo-element as a real element (use pseudo-element detection & style extraction code from nodeToSketchLayers)
    - [ ] If you have several slotted elements, only the first instances of each survive the Shadow DOM expansion in nodeToSketchGroup. Might be because the slotted content replacement code only matches the first instance?

# Style overrides
    - [x] Color styles to change icon colors
        const sharedStyles = [
            new SharedStyle({
                id: "white-shared-style",
                name: "White",
                fills: [{ color: "#fff" }]
            }),
            new SharedStyle({
                id: "black-shared-style",
                name: "Black",
                fills: [{ color: "#f00" }]
            })
        ];
        sharedStyles.map(sharedStyle => sketch.addLayerStyle(sharedStyle));
        - Shared styles are in document.json
        - Symbol master object has sharedStyleID that points to sharedStyle
        - Used from pages with

    layer.setResizingConstraint(resizingConstraintValues.top, resizingConstraintValues.left); // Return 27 (31 & 59)

            "minSize": 0
        }

# Images
    - [] SVG
        - PDFs can be embedded
        - svg-to-pdfkit...
    - [x] Download images https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52542149/how-can-i-download-images-on-a-page-using-puppeteer
    - [x] Inject images into Sketch document - asketch.json has bitmap entries, turn them into sketch-constructor
        new Bitmap({
            filePath: '/local/path.png',
            frame,
            style
        })
    - [x] IMG
    - [x] Images in CSS
        - [x] url()
        - [x] data:
        - [x] content
    - [x] Cross-origin images
    - [x] Formats
        - [x] PNG
        - [x] JPG

# Smoke test using whatever websites in inject.js

# Make a new branch for adding layout constraints, pseudo elements
    [x] :after and :before pseudo elements
    [x] :-webkit-slider-thumb and friends
    [x] -webkit-slider-track

# Nested symbols

- [x] Agent states - compare if has :hover, :focus, :active etc
    - [x] Generate state variant elements
    - [x] getComputedStyle with :foo
    - [x] Create variant names with :foo
    - Doesn't work, since getComputedStyle doesn't do :hover
    - There's a way to do it via Puppeteer https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/4057
    - [x] Shadow root handling for states
        - Can't get it working correctly
        - Ignore Shadow DOM, scale is deprecating it
    - [x] Investigate once more if we can programmatically do them
    - [x] Add :focus
    - [x] Add :active                  
- [x] Symbol names
    - [x] No crazy /null/0
    - [x] If param value long, just remove it
- [x] Override - parse layer name
    - Use layer name as prefix to override style name
    - Deal with instance creation failure
- [x] Create new symbol if frame differs
- [x] Accurate rendering or fewer symbols?
    - Accurate
- [x] Always use node names
- [x] Replace system fonts
- [x] Debug duplicate text styles
    - [x] Instead of name = variant, name = symbol / variant
- [x] Symbol Master text styles should use variant name if symbol master has one.

# Components tests

- [x] Use document as Sketch library
    - [x] Stable document ID
    - [x] Stable symbol IDs
    - [x] Bump symbol changeIdentifier on build

- [x] Better Sketch library stability
    - [x] Store document ID in symbol map
    - [x] Pass in symbol map filename
    - [x] Use Sqlite DB as symbol map
    - [x] Allow renaming symbols
        - [x] Use a stable symbol key for components instead of symbol name
        - [x] symbolKey -> symbolID -map
        - [x] Default symbolKey to symbol name
        - [x] Fix symbol renaming
            - Symbols in dropdown update name on Library update
            - Document layer names aren't updated on Library update (You need an extension for that (e.g. symbol instance renamer))

- [x] Propagate :hover states through Shadow DOM (including slot content)

- [x] Handle slot content better (copying the content tree under the slot element breaks styles, materializing the styles breaks the stylesheet overrides as style attribute takes precedence)
    - Slot content is now traversed similarly to shadow roots

- [ ] SVG styles shouldn't be materialized to DOM

- [x] Group layout should be applied to the first child as well (axis 0 layoutAnchor 1)

- [ ] groupLayout messes up some symbols, in some it works fine
    - Messed up
        - [x] Input field - actually this is fine, it should have a fixed size...
        - [ ] Textarea
        - [ ] Select box
        - [ ] Icons (stretched icon override)
    - Works fine
        - Button
        - Tag
        - Checkbox
        - Radio button
    - Looks as usual
        - Breadcrumb
        - Links
        - Accordion
        - Modal
        - Slider
        - Switch
        - Card

- [ ] Create text inside empty input and textarea
- [ ] Input label and placeholder
- [ ] List ordinals
- [ ] List bullets

- [ ] Button sizing wrong due to center aligned text
- [ ] Button symbols have 1px outline, messing up the size
- [ ] Icons not linked (still two groups of icons)
- [ ] Icons don't take color of buttons if I switch them

Commitments
===
- End of this week, we'd have all the easy-to-make-work stuff working
- There's ~4 components that are broken, fix each in a day and test the rest for issues
