# Telements

The [Telements site](https://github.com/telekom/telements) is the place for documentation on how to use Telements.


## Contributing Documentation Updates

The documentation content is formatted in markdown and can be found in the [src/docs directory](https://github.com/telekom/telements/tree/master/src/docs). Easiest way to make edits is to navigate to the markdown file to be updated, and click the Edit button in the top right (the pencil icon). After making the edit, submitting the changes will create a Pull Request (PR) for reviewed.


## Building the Site

To build the site from the source, ensure you're using the most recent versions of Node and Npm, and pull the lastest from master. Next, run `npm install` and `npm start` to launch the site in development mode.
