![Scale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telekom/scale/main/assets/Scale%20-%20The%20Telekom%20Digital%20Design%20System.png)

Scale is the digital design system for Telekom products and experiences. By default, Scale is built to align with our corporate brand and design but allows for easy customization to fit your particular product. It helps you build your digital products faster and create superior experiences with ease. With production-ready components for code and design, a central library, and comprehensive documentation, Scale has everything you need. Currently, Scale is an open beta.

Scale components are customizable and written in TypeScript. If you want to represent the corporate identity of a separate brand, you need to replace the Telekom default theme (see detailed instructions below).

# Welcome to Scale

Access the [comprehensive documentation for Scale](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/scale/) on [Telekom Brand & Design](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/).

# Are you a designer?

We provide a comprehensive Sketch library for designers building Telekom software. All components in the Sketch library are also available to your developers as code, making the handover very smooth and straightforward. For more information, access the [Scale website](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/scale/?path=/story/scale-for-designers-getting-started--page) with your Brand & Design credentials.

# Customizing Scale for open source software

Although the code for Scale is free and available under the MPL 2.0 License, Deutsche Telekom fully reserves all rights to the Telekom brand. To prevent users from getting confused about the source of a digital product or experience, there are strict restrictions on using the Telekom brand and design, even when built into code that we provide. For any customization other than explicitly for the Telekom, you must replace the Deutsche Telekom default theme.

To use Scale as open source software and customize it with a neutral theme, please follow the instructions for our [open source version](#open-source-version).

## Open source version

By following the instructions for the open source version, you obtain source code/packages that use a neutral theme and are fully covered by the MPL-2.0 License.

### Setup with NPM

```
npm install @telekom/scale-components-neutral
```

To use the components, you need to load a CSS file and some JavaScript. The CSS file includes the fonts and design tokens.

### Setup with plain HTML

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="node_modules/@telekom/scale-components-neutral/dist/scale-components/scale-components.css"
/>
<script
  type="module"
  src="node_modules/@telekom/scale-components-neutral/dist/scale-components/scale-components.esm.js"
></script>
```

### Setup with a bundler or ES modules

```javascript
import '@telekom/scale-components-neutral/dist/scale-components/scale-components.css';
import {
  applyPolyfills,
  defineCustomElements,
} from '@telekom/scale-components-neutral/loader';

applyPolyfills().then(() => {
  defineCustomElements(window);
});
```
